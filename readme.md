# My Custom QMK Firmware for Corne Keyboard (crkbd)

This repository is my custom fork of the [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), and using of the [qmk-translate-ansi-to-jis](https://github.com/m47ch4n/qmk-translate-ansi-to-jis), specifically tailored for the **Corne Keyboard (crkbd)**.  
Target keyboard is  **Corne Keyboard (crkbd)**: A split, column-staggered keyboard with customizable firmware.
